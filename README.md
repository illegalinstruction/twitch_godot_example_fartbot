# twitch_godot_example_fartbot
An example of how to construct an viewer-interactable Twitch overlay using Godot.  All the assets are CC0 (the sounds, the beachball) or LGPL (the typeface). 

Compiles and runs with Godot 3.4.x.  (Some assets are hidden by default and some code currently does not execute, in part because the project kind of grew by accretion while I experimented with it.  I'll fix it Later(tm).)

For instructions on how to use it, please see https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1494813604 .
